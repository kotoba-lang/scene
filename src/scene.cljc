  "KAMI Scene — tolerant EDN accessor helpers for the Datomic-shaped
  `scene.edn` a kami-clj game ships (ADR-0036). Native players
  (kami-clj-play/kami-clj-play3d) parse the *same* tolerant way:
  missing keys fall back to defaults rather than erroring, namespaced
  keywords match on `ns/name`, and numbers coerce int<->float.
  Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-scene Rust crate (103
  lines, deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove Rust
  workspace from kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  Unlike the original (which hand-parsed EDN via `kotoba_edn::EdnValue`
  since Rust has no native EDN reader), this namespace parses via
  Clojure's own `clojure.edn/read-string` — keys are already real
  keywords, so `kw-key`/`mget` operate directly on them rather than on
  a parsed-value wrapper type.

  Zero-dep portable CLJC."
